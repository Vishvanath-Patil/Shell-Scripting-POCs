# Shell-Scripting-POCs
Automating EC2 Instance Provisioning:

Create a shell script that uses the AWS CLI to provision an EC2 instance.
The script should take inputs for instance type, security groups, key pair, etc.
Use AWS CLI commands like aws ec2 run-instances and aws ec2 describe-instances to automate the provisioning process.
Autoscaling Group Management:

Create a script that interacts with the AWS CLI to manage Autoscaling Groups.
Implement functionality to dynamically scale the group based on certain conditions (e.g., CPU utilization, network traffic).
Use AWS CLI commands like aws autoscaling create-auto-scaling-group and aws autoscaling set-desired-capacity to perform autoscaling operations.
S3 Bucket Management:

Develop a script to automate the creation and configuration of S3 buckets.
Add functionality to set bucket policies, enable versioning, and configure lifecycle rules.
Utilize AWS CLI commands like aws s3api create-bucket and aws s3api put-bucket-policy for bucket management.
CloudWatch Logs Integration:

Create a shell script that sets up CloudWatch Logs for EC2 instances.
Configure log groups and log streams using the AWS CLI.
Implement log rotation and retention policies.
Utilize AWS CLI commands like aws logs create-log-group and aws logs put-retention-policy for CloudWatch Logs management.
AWS Lambda Function Deployment:

Develop a script that automates the deployment of AWS Lambda functions.
Package the code and dependencies into a deployment package.
Use AWS CLI commands like aws lambda create-function and aws lambda update-function-code to deploy and update Lambda functions.
CloudFormation Stack Deployment:

Create a script that deploys CloudFormation stacks.
Define the stack template and parameters in separate files.
Use the AWS CLI command aws cloudformation create-stack to deploy the stack.
These POCs demonstrate various aspects of shell scripting with AWS, including infrastructure provisioning, autoscaling, storage management, log integration, serverless deployment, and infrastructure-as-code. They can help you gain practical experience in automating AWS operations using shell scripts, which is a valuable skill for a DevOps engineer.
