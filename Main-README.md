# Shell-Scripting-POCs
Automating EC2 Instance Provisioning:

1# Create a shell script that uses the AWS CLI to provision an EC2 instance.
The script should take inputs for instance type, security groups, key pair, etc.
Use AWS CLI commands like aws ec2 run-instances and aws ec2 describe-instances to automate the provisioning process.
Autoscaling Group Management:

2# Create a script that interacts with the AWS CLI to manage Autoscaling Groups.
Implement functionality to dynamically scale the group based on certain conditions (e.g., CPU utilization, network traffic).
Use AWS CLI commands like aws autoscaling create-auto-scaling-group and aws autoscaling set-desired-capacity to perform autoscaling operations.
S3 Bucket Management:

3# Develop a script to automate the creation and configuration of S3 buckets.
Add functionality to set bucket policies, enable versioning, and configure lifecycle rules.
Utilize AWS CLI commands like aws s3api create-bucket and aws s3api put-bucket-policy for bucket management.
CloudWatch Logs Integration:

4# Create a shell script that sets up CloudWatch Logs for EC2 instances.
Configure log groups and log streams using the AWS CLI.
Implement log rotation and retention policies.
Utilize AWS CLI commands like aws logs create-log-group and aws logs put-retention-policy for CloudWatch Logs management.
AWS Lambda Function Deployment:

5# Develop a script that automates the deployment of AWS Lambda functions.
Package the code and dependencies into a deployment package.
Use AWS CLI commands like aws lambda create-function and aws lambda update-function-code to deploy and update Lambda functions.
CloudFormation Stack Deployment:

5# Create a script that deploys CloudFormation stacks.
Define the stack template and parameters in separate files.
Use the AWS CLI command aws cloudformation create-stack to deploy the stack.

6# Automated Deployment Pipeline:
Create a shell script that automates the deployment of an application to AWS.
Incorporate steps such as code checkout, building, testing, packaging, and deploying the application to EC2 instances or containers.
Utilize AWS CLI commands like aws s3 cp for artifact storage and aws ec2 run-instances or AWS Elastic Beanstalk for deployment.

7# Continuous Monitoring and Alerting:
Develop a shell script that sets up a monitoring solution using CloudWatch and SNS.
Automate the creation of CloudWatch alarms to monitor resource metrics, such as CPU utilization or network traffic.
Configure SNS notifications to alert the operations team via email or SMS when alarms are triggered.
Use AWS CLI commands like aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm for creating alarms and aws sns publish for sending notifications.

8# Automated Backup and Restore:
Create a shell script that automates the backup and restore process for an AWS resource, such as an RDS database or an S3 bucket.
Implement scheduled backups, backup retention policies, and automated restoration of backups.
Use AWS CLI commands like aws rds create-db-snapshot, aws rds restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot, or aws s3 sync for backup and restore operations.

9# Infrastructure Configuration Management:
Develop a script that uses AWS CLI commands to automate the configuration of infrastructure resources, such as EC2 instances, security groups, or load balancers.
Apply security configurations, set up networking rules, and configure resource-level permissions.
Utilize AWS CLI commands like aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute, aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress, or aws elbv2 create-load-
balancer for configuration management.

10# Cost Optimization:
Create a script that analyzes AWS resource usage and provides cost optimization recommendations.
Retrieve resource utilization data using AWS CLI commands like aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics.
Implement logic to identify idle resources, underutilized instances, or opportunities for Reserved Instance purchase.

These POCs cover various aspects of shell scripting with AWS, such as deployment automation, monitoring, backup management, infrastructure configuration, and cost optimization. Working on these projects will help you gain hands-on experience in leveraging shell scripting for DevOps tasks in an AWS environment.
